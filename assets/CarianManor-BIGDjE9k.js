# Outer League Carian Manor
Ranni has moved to the Cathedral of Manus Celes, which has left Carian Manor abandoned. *Oedon* believes that Ranni could be a powerful ally. So as a gesture of good faith you are tasked to Hitless Carian Manor and defeat the Full Grown Fallingstar Beast to take it back for Ranni. 

Oedon will be handing out **Cosmic Embers** for those who can overcome this challenge.

The Goal is simple: Complete **Carian Manor** Hitless. Due to *Oedon's* Arrival, some items and weapons work differently, so make sure to test everything out to accomplish a run. 

You can get a **Cosmic Ember** by:
- Completing a Run Hitless
- Completing the *Elite Enemies Challenge* Hitless
- Completing a Run under 5 Minutes

Only **Cosmic Ember** with a deadline for <t:1757307540:F>:
- Having the Most Creative Hitless Kill on the Full Grown Fallingstar Beast voted on by the community

This does mean that an Individual Player can get a total of 4 **Cosmic Embers**
